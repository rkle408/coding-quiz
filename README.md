## A quick quiz to test your knowledge of some coding! Don't worry, your legacy will remain intact... or downfall, if you choose!

Have you been paying attention? No need to answer that, we'll find out with our handy quiz!

One of the most fun ways to check your own knowledge is by creating a quiz! Notecards are too easy (who has them anyway?), rereading is fine (just a little boring...), and not studying is also an option (though not recommended!).

As we all learn more and more, it's important to remember our foundations and the <i>why</i> of it all. This could function (get it? anyone?) as a great referesher in the future.

In creating this quiz, I re-realized how much more important logic is than rote memorization of coding. I realized how long it takes to do CSS styling. I realized that I really don't need to take that long on it either. I learned the importance of not being attached to any of your code... that could change in the next moment, and you need to be okay with that. I also learned that there are so many ways to code, and there is a lot of reviewing and revising, so readability, organization, and meaningful notes are key to helping your team and your future self. (I also learned that dreaming of code over a holiday weekend doesn't help to actually write the code...)

As far as today, a lot more work needs to be done, so for now, I will leave you with this current website screenshot and deployment link to be updated in the future:
