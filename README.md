## A quick quiz to test your knowledge of some coding! Don't worry, your legacy will remain intact... or downfall, if you choose!

Have you been paying attention? No need to answer that, we'll find out with our handy quiz!

One of the most fun ways to check your own knowledge is by creating a quiz! Notecards are too easy (who has them anyway?), rereading is fine (just a little boring...), and not studying is also an option (though not recommended!).

As we all learn more and more, it's important to remember our foundations and the <i>why</i> of it all. This could function (get it? anyone?) as a great referesher in the future.

In creating this quiz, I re-realized how much more important logic is than rote memorization of coding. I realized how long it takes to do CSS styling. I realized that I really don't need to take that long on it either. I learned the importance of not being attached to any of your code... that could change in the next moment, and you need to be okay with that. I also learned that there are so many ways to code, and there is a lot of reviewing and revising, so readability, organization, and meaningful notes are key to helping your team and your future self.

#### Update

In refactoring my code, I learned that it is okay to start from scratch, even if you've built a lot of your code already! You can always go back to GitHub to find previous commits, but if you don't even try, you may get stuck at a dead-end. I learned that constant testing of snippets of new code is crucial to progression, as if you input a new code, it could break the whole thing. I learned the importance of not adding excessive semi-colons, that'll break a code too. I also learned it is easier to break functions up into singular functions, as they may be needed in more than one place.

Most importantly, I learned the importance of persevering through road-blocks, taking breaks to think of new ways to approach an issue, and being open-minded.
